# WierdLyrics2

Need lyrics? Here is how to get some.

1. Click Do Someting Wierd.
This will generate lyrics, partially randomized. This tool is used for generating rhyming lyrics, but do not follow any rules for meaning or grammar, and follows only 1 rule for beat patterns or rhythm. It just keeps the syllable count the same on each line.

2. Hum Fill.
Use this tool to record a hummed tune. Then it will be filled with lyrics. You set stop points and beat patterns for more granular control.

3. Revision tools.
This lets you combine all the tools of hum fill, but zoomed in on certain pieces of the music. You also have the rhyme helper and the thesaurus. You have good lyrics (from songs you like) available from other sites. Additionally plug in last.fm to get a list of music you like and take lyrics from there, according to beat pattern and rhyme.
